This has been done before (there's a reason you don't see these much anymore), just want to see how I would implement it. 

1. Data collection. Need lots of labeled captchas. There are/were about 30 different types of text based captchas used by different
websites. Maybe start with just one type.

2. How to extract characters from a captcha.

input with label in filename

find contours, get label from filename

3. Use the extracted characters to train a model.

4. Tune the model for better accuracy.

5. Try it out trying to break / crack / decode unlabeled input captchas.

6. Get more labeled captchas and different types and train other models.

7. Start over with trying out better or different data collection.
