This has been done before (there's a reason you don't see these much anymore), just want to see how I would implement it. 

1. Data collection. Need lots of labeled captchas. There are/were about 30 different types of text based captchas used by different
websites. Maybe start with just one type.

2. How to extract characters from a captcha.

input with label in filename

find contours, get label from filename

3. Use the extracted characters to train a model.

4. Try it out trying to break / crack / decode input captchas.

Here are some preliminary results after training with only 1,000 images and 10 training epochs:

So it's definitely do-able! Fom here I could start over and build a proper model with the 10,000 images that I have, or try
something more challenging - this model can only break these specific captchas, and I might be more interested in collecting
other more challenging types.

It also appears that, moving forward, you need to process the images better to extract the text:

5. Get more labeled captchas and different types and train other models.

6. Start over with trying out better or different data collection.

7. Tune a really good model and try to increase it's accuracy (with better data and hyper-tuning).
